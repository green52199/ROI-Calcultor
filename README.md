# ROI Calculator – Getting Started

This project is an ROI (Return on Investment) Calculator built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a clean and interactive interface for calculating ROI based on user-defined inputs.

## 🚀 Running the Project

In the project folder, you can run the following npm commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the ROI Calculator in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.\

The page reloads automatically when you edit the code, and any lint errors appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in watch mode.\
Helpful if you add custom logic or validation inside the calculator.

### `npm run build`

Creates an optimized production build of the ROI Calculator in the `build` folder.\
The output is minified, hashed, and ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This action is permanent.**\
Ejecting gives you full control over Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and more.\
Most projects do not need this — but it is available if deeper customization is required.
